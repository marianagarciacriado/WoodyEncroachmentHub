Readme

The analyses undertaken for this manuscript are split between multiple R scripts. 
They can be followed in a sequential order (i.e., 1 to 12), but I recommend skipping
running scripts #5 and most of script #6 as they deal with the extraction and manipulation of raster data from 
CHELSA (http://chelsa-climate.org/). There is a bit at the end of script #6 that can be run though.
Both the climatologies and time series are large files and are thus stored in a hard drive 
so it is not possible to run the scripts without access to the climatic raster files.
